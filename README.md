# Peltier-Based Liquid Cooling System

A system engineering project that demonstrates efficient thermal management using Peltier modules integrated with ESP32 microcontroller and a closed-loop control for liquid cooling. Ideal for compact electronics, IoT devices, and lab-scale thermal regulation experiments.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This prototype utilizes the thermoelectric effect of Peltier modules to create a compact and effective cooling system. A water circulation mechanism, powered by a 5V pump, removes heat from the hot side of the Peltier, while temperature sensors provide real-time feedback for adaptive control.
